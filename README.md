#ParseJSON in Android

##Notes:
- JSON is a light weight data-integration
- We can capture data from one program and integrate it in another program
- Aggregate data from different Sources. 

 	> Example: Delta App gets data from flight times, schedules, ticket number, flight status,  bank account etc.

- JSON is built into the Android platform
